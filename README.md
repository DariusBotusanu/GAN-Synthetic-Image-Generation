# MRI Image Generation using GAN and VAE

## Chosen Model

For the task of generating MRI images, we selected the **Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (WGAN)**. Architecturally, it closely resembles the **Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN)**. However, there's a crucial difference: the WGAN replaces the DCGAN's Discriminator with a **Critic**. Unlike the DCGAN's output in the [0,1] interval (indicating how fake or real the generated image is), the Critic assigns scores to the generated images without constraints on the bounds.

## Advantages of WGAN over Traditional GANs

1. **Stability in Training**: WGAN exhibits improved stability during training.
2. **Wasserstein Metric**: Instead of the KL Divergence, WGAN uses the Wasserstein metric as a more interpretable loss function.
3. **Mitigates Mode Collapse**: WGAN encourages more diverse image generation by mitigating mode collapse.
4. **No Saturating Loss**: The consistent learning throughout training is achieved without the issue of saturating loss.

## Architecture

The key architectural features of our models include:
- **BatchNorm2d** layers after convolutional layers to stabilize training.
- **LeakyReLU** activation function, which ensures nonlinearity and allows negative values (unlike ReLU).

## Evaluation

To assess the performance of our WGAN, we computed the **Inception Score** on 5 folds, each containing 20 synthetic images. The resulting scores are as follows:
- Fold 1: 0.6659
- Fold 2: 0.7127
- Fold 3: 0.6684
- Fold 4: 0.7187
- Fold 5: 0.6857

The standard deviation around 0.02 indicates that the values do not deviate significantly from the mean score of 0.69.

## Other Models

As a baseline for image generation, we also considered a **Variational Autoencoder (VAE)**. However, upon visual inspection, we confirmed that the quality of images generated by the VAE falls short compared to those produced by the WGAN.
